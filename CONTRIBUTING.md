# How to Help Contribute to GmodVR
### Issues
  When creating an issue, please make sure you have sufficient information about what happened so something can be done about it. Please also make sure to use the issue template to provide as much information as possible.

### Pull Requests
  Glad to see you want to add something to this project! Just a few things to go over first before you submit a pull request:
  1. Playtest your addition to make sure it has no LUA errors or conflicts with addons (non-unique hook names are 99% of such conflicts)
  2. Make sure there are no compatibility errors with the current branch, and if necessary, update your branch if something's changed since you forked it
  3. When creating a pull request, please title it appropriately, and provide a detailed description of what functionality it adds (applies to .md file editing too!)
  4. Good luck! We apprectiate you contributing to GmodVR!
